Description: The goal of 'prague' is to provide the production-oriented functions for a 'golem' app.
    This way, when you deploy an app built with 'golem', you'll only have to install one dependency
    for 'prague', not the ones for 'golem' (which are more numerous). 'prague' only 
    has one direct dependencies: 'shiny', making applications more lightweight and easier to deploy.

# prague

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `{prague}` is to provide the production-oriented functions for a `{golem}` app. 

This way, when you deploy an app built with `{golem}`, you'll only have to install one dependency: `{shiny}`, not the one for `{golem}` (which are more numerous), making it lightweight to deploy.

## Installation

You'll probably never will have to install `{prague}` by hand (most of the time it's added by creating a `{golem}` app).

But right now, you can get `{prague}` from GitHub with: 

```r
remotes::install_github("thinkr-open/prague")
```
